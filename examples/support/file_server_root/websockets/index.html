      <h1>Websocket Integration</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Aerys integrates full support for the websocket protocol as a first-class citizen.
      </p>

      <h3>Websockets Your Way</h3>
      
      <p>
        Aerys provides multiple options for structuring websocket endpoints in relation to the
        non-websocket portions of an application:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Host websocket endpoints exclusively on an Aerys host</li>
        <li>Layer websocket endpoints over another Aerys host application (on top of static files or a dynamic app)</li>
        <li>Use Aerys's reverse proxy feature to add ws:// and wss:// endpoints on top of existing applications <em>that don't use Aerys</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <hr />
      
      <h3>Proxies Aren't a Fix: They're A Band-Aid</h3>
      
      <p>
        The Websocket protocol designers really got it right when they used HTTP's upgrade mechanism and
        standard ports (80/443) to listen for traffic. Because these ports are guaranteed to be open in corporate
        firewalls you can be sure of your application's ability to communicate with clients via
        websockets. However, this creates a problem for PHP applications running behind traditional
        SAPIs because the front-facing web server is already listening on these reserved ports. If
        you want to run a normal PHP application behind say, Apache, you're forced to setup a proxy
        server to direct regular traffic to the backend Apache server while routing websocket traffic
        to your websocket server. Let's be clear: <em>this proxying approach is not a solution, it's
        a band-aid.</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This problem is nonexistent in an Aerys application because Aerys is it's own server; it can
        seamlessly upgrade a connection from http:// to ws:// without skipping a beat.
      </p>
      
      <hr />
      
      <h3>Full wss:// TLS and Modding Support</h3>
      
      <p>
        Because Aerys provides full SSL/TLS encryption support you don't have to do any additional
        setup to achieve secure websocket connections. Additionally, websocket endpoints have the
        same access to modding functionality as any other Aerys application. This means your websocket
        apps can log requests, rate-limit users and do anything else that's possible with Aerys mods.
      </p>
      
      <hr />
      
      <h3>Add Websockets To Existing SAPI Applications</h3>
      
      <p>
        Already have a PHP application running on FastCGI or Apache? No problem. You can add websocket
        support in minutes by changing the port your existing server listens on. Aerys can then
        reverse proxy requests to the primary application while intercepting and handling requests
        for your websocket endpoints.
