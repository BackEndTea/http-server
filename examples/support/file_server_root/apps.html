      <h1>Dynamic Web Applications</h1>
      <p class="lead">Aerys makes RESTful PHP applications a reality.</p>
      <hr />
      
      <h3>Why? Doesn't Core PHP Already Do This?</h3>
      <p>@TODO: PHP's HTTP abstractions kind of suck, actually.</p>
      
      <h3>Host-Based vs. File-Based Apps</h3>
      
      <p>
        In the early days of the web HTTP was used primarily to share static files between clients and
        servers. Naturally, major HTTP server applications over the years have catered to static file
        serving while bolting support for dynamically generated applications on top of this
        <i>"file-centric"</i> model. In traditional servers (like Apache), dynamic files
        are treated like static files with the twist that they are executed and not served verbatim
        to the client.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aerys takes a different approach to dynamic HTTP applications in that it views each individual
        named host as its own <i>"application."</i> Each host must define a primary
        <a href="/asgi.html" title="ASGI specification">ASGI application handler</a> to which the
        environment array will be passed upon the receipt of a client request. It is the application's
        job, then, to respond programmatically to the request based on the request's environment values.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Aerys server acts as a simple clearing-house for requests and responses passing them to
        and from the application handler for each host on the server. Additionally, Aerys exposes
        <a href="/mods/" title="Aerys modding and customization">mod event hooks</a> allowing 
        customization and extensibility at specific points during the lifecycle of a request-response pair.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Built-in Application Handlers</h3>
      <p>
        Aerys comes pre-packaged with a small number of handlers for standard use-cases. These
        handlers are listed below ...
      </p>
      
      <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Handler</th><th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          
          <tr>
            <td>Reverse Proxy</td>
            <td>
              Proxy all requests for the host to any one of several backend servers identified by
              IP and port. Uses HTTP/1.1 keep-alive for long-lived connections to backend servers.
              This handler is extremely useful for layering websocket endpoints and application-specific
              content caching rules on top of a preexisting application behind an Apache/Nginx/etc server.
            </td>
          </tr>
          
          <tr>
            <td>Static Files</td>
            <td>
              Despite the dynamic nature of modern web applications static file serving remains an
              important aspect of any HTTP app. Aerys provides a performant HTTP/1.1 compliant static
              file application handler to address this need. Prime your app for scalability by hosting
              static files from a named subdomain such as <i>http://static.mysite.com</i> to allow
              a seamless transition down the road to a CDN or server optimized for file serving
              (like Nginx) as your needs change.<br />

          </tr>
          
          <tr>
            <td>Websockets</td>
            <td>
              OMG can PHP really solve the <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">C10K PROBLEM</a>
              and do <i>webscale</i>? Yes. Yes it can. Aerys makes websockets as outlined in
              <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455" title="RFC 6455"> RFC 6455</a> a first
              class citizen. Traditional PHP websocket solutions require a proxy server because the
              real front-facing server -- be it Lighttpd, Apache, Nginx, etc -- is already taking up
              the ports (80/443) on which the websocket protocol listens. Aerys <i>is its own</i>
              event-driven server and does not run behind a traditional PHP SAPI layer. This means
              that it can delegate control of the appropriate client sockets as needed to its own
              websocket handling mechanism after negotiating the websocket handshake. Note that Aerys
              allows Websocket handler usage over both standard and TLS-encrypted connections.<br />
