/**
 * A ClientException thrown from Body::read() or Body::buffer() indicates that
 * the requesting client stream has been closed, likely due to exceeding the
 * body size limit.
 *
 * Applications may optionally catch this exception in Responders to continue
 * other processing. Users are NOT required to catch it and if left
 * uncaught it will simply end responder execution. For streaming response bodies
 * in which the handler is also reading the request body, this exception should
 * be caught and used to fail the streaming response body.
 *
 * Creating and throwing a ClientException from a Responder or failing streaming
 * response body will abruptly disconnect a client.
 *
 * Responses returned by Responders after a ClientException has been thrown will
 * be ignored, as a response has already been generated by the error handler and
 * the client disconnected.
